## Description
- My motivation for this project was to be able to further understand how to use React to create a clean and polished UI.
- I built this project to have a professional portfolio that will show my skills to potential employers.
- This project solves the problem of having a centralized space for employers to see my work and contact me for potential job openings.
- I learned how to creat React components and how to dynamically create a clean portfolio with React and have different pages using React Router.
